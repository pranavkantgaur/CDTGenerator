Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization attempts to retain Delunay property for cells while ensuring preservation of constraint vertices, segments and facets. \r\n\r\n# Terminology\r\nDelaunay: Let V be the set of vertices of X(a PLC). Let σ be any simplex formed by vertices of V . σ is delaunay if there exists a circumsphere of σ that encloses no vertex of V.\r\n\r\nEdge Protected: X is edge-protected if every segment of X is strongly delaunay.\r\n\r\nDelaunay tetrahedralization: A Delaunay tetrahedralization D of V is a tetrahedralization such that all simplices of D are delaunay.\r\n\r\nContrained Delaunay: A tetrahedron t formed by vertices of X is constrained delaunay if its circumsphere encloses no vertex of X which is visible from any point in the relative interior of t.\r\n\r\nConstrained tetrahedralization: A tetrahedralization T is a constrained tetrahedralization of X if T and X have exactly the same vertices, and the tetrahedra in T cover the convex hull of V . every segment of X is an edge of T , every facet of X is a union of triangular faces of T .\r\n\r\nCDT: A constrained tetrahedralization T of X is said to be a constrained delaunay tetrahedralization (CDT) of X if each tetrahedron of T is constrained delaunay.\r\n\r\nLocal Degenracy: Let D be the delaunay tetrahedralization of the vertices of X, t a tetrahedron in D and t' an adjacent tetrahedron of t (sharing a face with t), V the set of vertices of t, t'. If all vertices of V lie on a common sphere, V is called a local degeneracy of X.\r\n\r\n# The Two alternatives\r\nThe paper highlights two ways to get to be sure that a CDT exists.The implementation is done using the second alternative because using second alternative the facet recovery(last step) can be carried out efficiently.\r\n\r\nFirst Way: If X is edge protected ,then X has a CDT.  \r\n\r\nSecond Way: If D(delaunay tetrahedralization) contains no local degeneracy and contains all segments of X, then the CDT of X exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Algorithm overview\r\nAlgorithm is based on [Shewchuck's theorem](www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/cdt.pdf) which states that: 'If a PLC _X_ is _edge protected_ and there are no cospherical 5-points in vertex set of _X_ then CDT of X exists'.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm first transforms the input _Piecewise linear complex_(or PLC) to a PLC which is edge protected and then removes any degenerate point set and then tranformed PLC is guarnateed to have CDT. Precisely,  \r\n1. Computes initial Delaunay tetrahedralization  \r\n2. Makes segments _strongly delaunay_. This is done by recovering the missing segments of the PLC in the new Delaunay tetrahedralization.  \r\n3. Removes _local_ degeneracies. This is done by either perturbing vertices or inserting new vertices.    \r\n4. Recovers facets using _cavity retetrahedralization_  \r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\nThis implementation extensively uses CGAL's [Delaunay triangulation](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation_3/index.html#Triangulation_3Delaunay) and [Linear Cell complex](http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Linear_cell_complex/index.html) modules. \r\n\r\n# Building\r\nThe code is under testing right now but one can get fair idea of overall steps involved in implementation of Hang Si's Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization(CDT) algorithm.\r\n\r\n# Extension\r\nMain objective is to extend this implementation to support adaptive Constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization for 3D domain.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
